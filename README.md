# HyperWare

## Overview

HyperWare is a Python-based tool designed to facilitate fast switching between multiple user accounts on Windows systems with enhanced security measures. The program lists available user accounts and allows users to switch between them efficiently while performing basic security checks.

## Features

- Lists all available user accounts on the system.
- Facilitates quick switching between user accounts.
- Performs enhanced security checks before switching.

## Requirements

- Windows Operating System
- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hyperware.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd hyperware
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python hyperware.py
